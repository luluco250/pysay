# Cowsay implementation in Python

Barebones implementations of the classic `cowsay` Unix program in Python.

No options other than receiving input from stdin (piping) or receiving a string
as the first argument, focused on replicating the default look of the original
program.

Essentially acts as `cowsay -n`.

Requires Python 3.
